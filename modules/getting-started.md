Getting Started
=============

To install a module upload the contents to **/application/modules** and then navigate to Setup > Modules in your Administrator panel. Click "Enable" on your uploaded module and then navigate to Permissions if the module has any to set them up with your Groups.

From here on we will cover the process of developing a module from group up. At the end of this tutorial you will have a fully working module that you can distribute to other BPanel installations.
